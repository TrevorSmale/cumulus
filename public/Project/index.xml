      <description>How it started Over the years, I have been involved in delivering both in-person and online courses, using a range of Learning and Course Management tools such as Evernote, Excel, GitHub, and others. While I have managed to make these solutions work for my needs, I have come to realize that they are not ideal for creating a seamless and efficient learning environment.&#xA;As part of my journey to enhance my applied IT skills, I delved into the world of self-hosting and explored various solutions like VMs, LXC containers, and Docker containers.</description>

While creating a digital typewriter like Stringer may not be a new idea, I am confident in my ability to conduct thorough research on the topic and arrive at unique ideas and thoughtful design decisions.</description>

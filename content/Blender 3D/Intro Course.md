# Hardware Requirements

## Blender Foundation recommendations

Blender does have some special hardware requirements that may not be satisfied by the average computer.
Blender.org lists the minimum hardware requirements as follows:

* 64-bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support.
* 8 GB RAM.
* Full HD display.
* Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet.
* Graphics card with 2 GB RAM, OpenGL 4.3.
* Less than 10 year old.

Please note that these are the minimum system requirements. If you are planning on using this software to create more advanced projects, it is best to look at what Blender artists recommend.

# Additional Notes:

## Graphics

It is best to have a [Dedicated Graphics Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card "Wiki Page") for using 3D software like Blender. 3D modeling and rendering typically utilizes large amounts of virtual memory. Dedicated graphics cards have additional virtual memory for this purpose. Some integrated graphics systems in laptops and mini computers work for light projects as well. It is best to do a bit of personal research into the matter. 

Most cards over the past decade will be just fine so long as you're packing at least 2GB of video memory on the Nvidia GeForce 400 series, AMD's Radeon HD 7000 range, or newer. CPU-wise, you're looking at a quad-core processor to get the program running.

If this information is making your head spin, then the demo scene stress test should at least confirm that your computer will work for this course.

## Mouse

I urge you to use a dedicated mouse with a mechanical clickable centrewheel. The clickable centrewheel will be used often for panning and rotation of the 3D scene. Most mid-grade dedicated mice include this feature. 

Until you are familiar with the interface, please do note use:

* A trackpad
* A touch-based mouse eg. Apple Magic Mouse
* A digitizer tablet eg. Wacom

If you in need of a different mouse, here are a few low cost recommendations that are easy to find online or pick up at staples. Note: both of these mice do not have bluetooth and require a USB A port for the wireless receiver.

[Logitech 2.5 ghz wireless M325 mouse on Amazon Canada](https://www.amazon.ca/Logitech-M325-Wireless-Mouse-910-002650/dp/B005HQ514C/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3K667NFXFTVIZ&keywords=logitech+m325&qid=1674593045&refinements=p_85%3A5690392011%2Cp_36%3A12035760011&rnid=12035759011&rps=1&s=electronics&sprefix=logitech+m325%2Caps%2C77&sr=1-3 "Amazon Link")

## Display

Blender has a rather large and complex user interface with many small buttons and windows. It is best to use a large, high resolution monitor in order to maximize the UI spread. Otherwise, buttons may be hidden or minimized, causing some confusion for the uninitiated.

# Install & Test

## A) Overview

Downloading and installing Blender is normally a straightforward process. However, if you have never tested the software on your particular computer hardware it is best to download, install and open a demo file for quick testing. Furthermore, I would like to ensure we are all using a similar installation with default settings and layout. 

## B) Recommended Blender version

Blender is under constant development meaning there are small incremental releases happening weekly. Implementing small changes on a constant basis can cause instability or bugs to the end user. I recommend downloading a Long Term Release version as these versions are intended for studios that favor reliability over new features. The latest (LTS) release version is version 3.3.3

[Direct Link to 3.3 LTS release download](https://www.blender.org/download/lts/3-3/ "Blender LTS page")

## C) Running a demo file

Once you have Blender installed, it is best to open a demo scene to check for crashing or other bugs. 
[There is a page hosted by the organization](https://www.blender.org/download/demo-files/ "Blender Demo Files Download Page") that allows anyone to download open sourced demo scenes.

## 1. Download demo scene

This course will not be taxing on your system as we are using basic features. I recommend downloading the 'Classroom Scene' created by Christophe Seux. [Here is a direct link to downloading the file.](https://download.blender.org/demo/test/classroom.zip "Blender Classroom Demo File")

## 2. Open demo scene

Once you have downloaded the demo file, unzip it and open the classroom.blend file. Upon first opening the file you should see this:

![Blender Classroom Screen Shot](img/bc_ss_io.png "Initial screen of Blender Classroom Scene")

## 3. Enable 'Viewport Shading'

In order to test the capability of your computer for rendering click this button circled in red:

![Blender Classroom Screen Shot Render Button](img/bc_ss_io_ic.png "Initial screen of Blender Classroom Scene Initiate Render")

Once you have clicked the 'Viewport shading button' as indicated by the red circle, patiently wait for the scene to load. The time to load varies depending on what computer you are using. I would suggest leaving this process for 1-10 mins.

## 4. Confirm the demo scene has rendered correctly

The scene should render within that suggested timeframe and look like this. Note: there is text in the upper left corner that indicates the loading, rendering and completion of the scene as indicated here.

![Blender Classroom Screen Shot Render Button](img/bc_ss_io_rd.png "Initial screen of Blender Classroom Scene Initiate Render")

If your scene looks like this screenshot then you have successfully stress tested your machine and are ready to take on this course. By completing this stress test we can now deduce that:

* Your Blender 3.3.3 installation was successful.
* You have opened your first Blender file.
* Your machine is capable of rendering [Raytraced.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)"Wikipedia Page for Raytracing Graphics") light successfully.
* You are ready to begin the course!

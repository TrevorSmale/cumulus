## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service provided by Microsoft Azure. It serves as the foundation for managing user identities and controlling access to Azure resources. Azure AD allows you to create and manage user accounts, groups, and guest accounts. With Azure AD, you can implement single sign-on (SSO) for seamless access to various applications and services. It also provides features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

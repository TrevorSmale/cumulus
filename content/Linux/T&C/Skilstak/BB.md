# 2023 Boost - Week 4

Let's do this again. Weeks 2 and 3 were a little harder than most beginners might be able to handle. Most Linux users will be using a Linux that has been installed already. The Boost is primarily intended for *them* (not admins and hackers, who are also users). So we've prepared a quick-start with an existing Linux container image. Here's how to get it and another take at how to get going without having to setup anything.

1. What concepts do all *users* need to understand?
1. What does it mean to be a Linux "user" (vs "admin" or "hacker")?
1. Create a local Linux container for the Boost

    ```sh
    podman run -it --hostname skilstak --name boost -v shared://shared ghcr.io/rwxrob/ws-skilstak
    ```

1. What is the difference between a terminal and a command line?
1. What do the parts of the prompt mean?
1. How do I clear the screen?
    * Do not depend on Control-L
    * `clear` (or `c`)
1. How do I see where I am?
    * `pwd`
1. How do I see everything in this directory?
    * `ls -al`
1. How do get help information about a command?
    * `CMD -h` or `CMD --help`
    * `man CMD`
    * `help CMD`
    * `apropos KEYWORD` (if you want)
1. What is a directory and what is a file?
1. What are special directories?
    * current: `.`
    * parent: `..`
    * previous: `-`
    * home: `~`
1. How do I change directories?
    * `cd DIR`
    * `cd -`
    * `cd ..`
    * `cd`
1. How do I see what's in a file?
    * `cat FILE [FILE]`
    * `tac FILE [FILE]`
    * `more FILE`
    * `less FILE`
    * `head FILE`
    * `tail FILE`
1. What is a file descriptor and how do I use them?
    * Understand origins of TTY (teletype machines)
    * standard input (`/dev/stdin`, 0)
    * standard output (`/dev/stdout`, 1)
    * standard error (`/dev/stderr`, 2)
1. What is a pipe?
    * `ls -al | more`
1. How do write output of a command to a file?
    * `ls -al > /tmp/foo`
1. How do I append command output to end of a file?
    * `echo some >> /tmp/foo`
    * `echo thing >> /tmp/foo`
1. How do I zero out an existing or new file?
    * `> /tmp/foo`
1. How do I create a new file (or update time changed)?
    * `touch /tmp/foo`
1. How do I remove a file?
    * `rm FILE`
1. How do I find files with a keyword in the name?
    * `find . -name '*vim*' 2> /dev/null`
1. How do I send stderr to stdout as well?
    * `find / -name '*md*' 1> /tmp/foo 2> /dev/stdout`
    * `find / -name '*md*' > /tmp/foo 2> /dev/stdout`
    * `find / -name '*md*' > /tmp/foo 2>&1`
    * `find / -name '*md*' &> /tmp/foo`

# 2023 Boost - Week 5

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/ZcEIJFbHRn4>

This week we do "destructive" file system stuff related and take a lot of time to review the most common dangers. Watch this is you want to *keep* your job once you get it.

1. How do I create a new directory?
   
    ```sh
    mkdir NAME
    ```

1. How do I "hide" a file or directory?

    Give it a dot (`.`) as the first character in name.

1. How do I move or rename a file or directory?

    `mv OLD NEW`

    !!! danger
        Be very careful when moving and renaming since you can easily clobber an existing file or directory. Don't bother with activating `noclobber` because it will get in your way more than help you, just become aware/paranoid about the danger.

1. How do I move multiple files into a single directory?

    ```sh
    mv SOURCE... DIR
    ```

    SOURCE can be a file, directory (or path to) or a glob.

    !!! danger
        When moving muliple SOURCEs make *sure* that DIR is a directory and not a file.

    !!! note
        Note that `mv` sometimes will not work because the source and destination are on different file systems.

1. How do I list properties of a directory (instead of contents)?

    ```sh
    ls -lda DIR
    ```

1. How do I safely avoid typing long or complicated names?

    Tap tab (once or twice) for tab completion.

1. How do I remove a file?

    ```sh
    rm FILE
    ```

    !!! tip
        When working with destructive commands that operate on many files try `ls` first to make sure it only affects the files you want.

1. How do I create a temporary container (sandbox) just to try dangerous (stupid) things?

    ```sh
    podman run -it --rm ghcr.io/rwxrob/ws-skilstak
    ```

1. How do I remove a directory?

    ```sh
    rmdir DIR
    ```

    !!! note
        Prefer `rmdir` over alternatives to force yourself to be sure of each individual thing that is being deleted within that directory (since `rmdir` will not remove directories containing).

1. How do I remove a directory and everything under it recursively?

    ```sh
    rm -rf DIR
    ```

    !!! danger
        Even though this command does not work on significant system directories (like `/`) it is very recursively destructive and should almost never be used. Use `rmdir` instead.

1. How do I recover a broken or deleted configuration file?

    ```sh
    cp /etc/skel/FILE ~
    ```

1. How do I start a new shell and replace the currently running one?

    ```sh
    exec bash -l
    ```

1. How do I copy a file?

    ```sh
    cp FILE NEWNAME
    ```

1. How do I recusively copy a directory and subdirectories?

    ```sh
    cp -r SOURCE.. DIR
    ```

    !!! note
        This creates new files with new creation dates/times and ownership if copying from another user. Use other `cp` argument options when preserving them is important.

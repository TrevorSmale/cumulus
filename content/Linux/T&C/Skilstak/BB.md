# 2023 Boost - Week 4 [x]

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/SPoqW1CMEhY> [x]

Let's do this again. Weeks 2 and 3 were a little harder than most beginners might be able to handle. Most Linux users will be using a Linux that has been installed already. The Boost is primarily intended for *them* (not admins and hackers, who are also users). So we've prepared a quick-start with an existing Linux container image. Here's how to get it and another take at how to get going without having to setup anything.

1. What concepts do all *users* need to understand? [x]
2. What does it mean to be a Linux "user" (vs "admin" or "hacker")? [x]
3. Create a local Linux container for the Boost [x]

    ```sh
    podman run -it --hostname skilstak --name boost -v shared://shared ghcr.io/rwxrob/ws-skilstak
    ```

4. What is the difference between a terminal and a command line? [x]
5. What do the parts of the prompt mean? [x]
6. How do I clear the screen? [x]

7. How do I see where I am? [x]
    * `pwd` [x]
8. How do I see everything in this directory? [x]
    * `ls -al` [x]
9. How do get help information about a command? [x]
    * `CMD -h` or `CMD --help` [x]
    * `man CMD` [x]
    * `help CMD` [x]
    * `apropos KEYWORD` (if you want) [x]
10. What is a directory and what is a file? [x]
11. What are special directories? [x]
    * current: `.` [x]
    * parent: `..` [x]
    * previous: `-` [x]
    * home: `~` [x]
12. How do I change directories? [x]
    * `cd DIR` [x]
    * `cd -` [x]
    * `cd ..` [x]
    * `cd` [x]
12. How do I see what's in a file? [x]
    * `cat FILE [FILE]` [x]
    * `tac FILE [FILE]` [x]
    * `more FILE` [x]
    * `less FILE` [x]
    * `head FILE` [x]
    * `tail FILE` [x]
13. What is a file descriptor and how do I use them? [x]
    * Understand origins of TTY (teletype machines) [x]
    * standard input (`/dev/stdin`, 0) [x]
    * standard output (`/dev/stdout`, 1) [x]
    * standard error (`/dev/stderr`, 2) [x]
14. What is a pipe? [x]
    * `ls -al | more` [x]
15. How do write output of a command to a file? [x]
    * `ls -al > /tmp/foo` [x]
16. How do I append command output to end of a file? [x]
    * `echo some >> /tmp/foo` [x]
    * `echo thing >> /tmp/foo` [x]
17. How do I zero out an existing or new file? [x]
    * `> /tmp/foo` [x]
18. How do I create a new file (or update time changed)? [x]
    * `touch /tmp/foo` [x]
19. How do I remove a file? [x]
    * `rm FILE` [x]
20. How do I find files with a keyword in the name? [x]

# 2023 Boost - Week 5 [x]

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/ZcEIJFbHRn4> [x]

This week we do "destructive" file system stuff related and take a lot of time to review the most common dangers. Watch this is you want to *keep* your job once you get it.

1. How do I create a new directory? [x]
   
    ```sh
    mkdir NAME
    ```

2. How do I "hide" a file or directory? [x]

    Give it a dot (`.`) as the first character in name.

3. How do I move or rename a file or directory? [x]

    `mv OLD NEW`

    !!! danger
        Be very careful when moving and renaming since you can easily clobber an existing file or directory. Don't bother with activating `noclobber` because it will get in your way more than help you, just become aware/paranoid about the danger.

4. How do I move multiple files into a single directory? [x]

    ```sh
    mv SOURCE... DIR
    ```

    SOURCE can be a file, directory (or path to) or a glob.

    !!! danger
        When moving muliple SOURCEs make *sure* that DIR is a directory and not a file.

    !!! note
        Note that `mv` sometimes will not work because the source and destination are on different file systems.

5. How do I list properties of a directory (instead of contents)? [x]

    ```sh
    ls -lda DIR
    ```

6. How do I safely avoid typing long or complicated names? [x]

    Tap tab (once or twice) for tab completion.

7. How do I remove a file? [x]

    ```sh
    rm FILE
    ```

    !!! tip
        When working with destructive commands that operate on many files try `ls` first to make sure it only affects the files you want.

8. How do I create a temporary container (sandbox) just to try dangerous (stupid) things? [x]

    ```sh
    podman run -it --rm ghcr.io/rwxrob/ws-skilstak
    ```

9. How do I remove a directory? [x]

    ```sh
    rmdir DIR
    ```

    !!! note
        Prefer `rmdir` over alternatives to force yourself to be sure of each individual thing that is being deleted within that directory (since `rmdir` will not remove directories containing).

10. How do I remove a directory and everything under it recursively? [x]

    ```sh
    rm -rf DIR
    ```

    !!! danger
        Even though this command does not work on significant system directories (like `/`) it is very recursively destructive and should almost never be used. Use `rmdir` instead.

11. How do I recover a broken or deleted configuration file? [x]

    ```sh
    cp /etc/skel/FILE ~
    ```

12. How do I start a new shell and replace the currently running one? [x]

    ```sh
    exec bash -l
    ```

13. How do I copy a file? [x]

    ```sh
    cp FILE NEWNAME
    ```

14. How do I recusively copy a directory and subdirectories? [x]

    ```sh
    cp -r SOURCE.. DIR
    ```

    !!! note
        This creates new files with new creation dates/times and ownership if copying from another user. Use other `cp` argument options when preserving them is important.

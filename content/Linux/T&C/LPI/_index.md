## History 

Note: (From Site)

Back in 1998, Apple released the iMac and Microsoft released Windows98. Unix was still a force on server computers but Microsoft Windows NT was promising major inroads into the server space. Linux was rapidly becoming a growing phenomenon with millions of users worldwide. Upstart companies, such as Red Hat and SUSE, were attracting the attention of corporate users with their commercial packaging and support of Linux, but analysts and IT journalists maintained Linux would never get beyond a niche presence without dramatic increases in professional support.

That year, two separate community efforts were building momentum to try to address one of the perceived deep gaps in Linux support.  If a company chose to deploy Linux, how would an IT manager be able to find qualified people to install, maintain, and support it?

At the time, there were a large number of certification programs for Microsoft Windows systems and they provided a mechanism for companies to try to understand someone’s expertise with Windows. Could there be some similar kind of certification program for Linux?  Red Hat started to develop their own certification for their Linux distribution. Several other distribution vendors started to mention creating their own certifications. Some people within the Linux community started to be concerned that we might wind up with multiple smaller Linux certifications that wouldn’t help advance the deployment of Linux as much as a common certification would.

In October 1998, Dan York published in the Linux Gazette an article calling for a community Linux certification program, resulting in an active community discussion group. Dan would go on to write a series of articles, with one outcome being that Linuxcare, a startup offering Linux support, contacted Dan and employed him specifically to build the LPI certification program.

Meanwhile, a separate discussion led by Evan Leibovitch at the Canadian Linux Users Exchange was promoting a similar initiative. Jon “maddog” Hall, President of Linux International, who knew both Evan and Dan, introduced them, and they merged their efforts into a single project to create a community-based Linux certification program. The agreed objective was to take a different path from most IT certifications of the day, by being:

Non-profit
Neutral with regard to vendors, open source operating systems, and software distributions
Opposed to using certification as a tool to sell “official training”
Psychometrically-validated
Multilingual and globally accessible

## LPI certification proves you have the skills.

Verified credentials get you to the top of the resume pile and on recruiter hot lists. It’s the quickest way through the HR firewall.

LPI’s distribution neutral certification shows Linux versatility. Rather than being limited to one particular vendor technology, you will be able to work with multiple open source technologies – mirroring actual work environments.   Certifying at the command line means you can work with any Linux distribution.

With detailed exam objectives, your exam prep time is better spent because you know what to study. Our multi-level track verifies you have the most comprehensive breadth and depth of Linux and open source knowledge. Our certifications are valid for 5-years, longer than most competitive certifications.

## Exam Development

LPI’s exam development process is detailed, thorough, participatory, collaborative and employs many proven techniques used by the best IT certification programs.
Psychometrics

Psychometrics, the study of testing and measuring mental capacity, is used throughout LPI certification development to ensure that our exams reflect the needs of the IT community and industry.
Development Structure

As a part of our ongoing certification development process we continually monitor the needs of the Linux and IT markets to ensure our exams effectively evaluate candidates on the most relevant skills.

When we began this process in the late 1990’s we initially launched a two-tiered certification track that became what is known as LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 today. Over the years we have expanded our offerings to include the third tier to the LPIC professional track with the three enterprise specialties of LPIC-3. We’ve also introduced an entry-level certificate program, Linux Essentials, for those see

## Job Task Analysis

After development of a program structure and a job description for an exam or series, the next stage is to scientifically determine the skills, tasks and areas of knowledge needed for the job. The challenge: Anyone could come up with a list of tasks they think a Linux professional should be able to do. If you ask 10 Linux professionals what a “junior-level” professional should do, you might get 10 lists.

Which list is correct?

Our solution: We ask a large number of Linux professionals for their lists of necessary job duties, and then compile the responses to find the common and most important tasks. The most important tasks show up on all lists.

This process is called job analysis study or job task analysis. LPI has completed extensive job analysis surveys of Linux professionals to help ensure exams are unbiased and constructed fairly.
How we do it:

### Pre-survey

First we work with a large pool of subject-matter experts to compile an exhaustive list of all the tasks that they think might be performed by the target audience of the certification.
Job Analysis Survey

Next, the tasks collected during the pre-survey go into a job analysis survey. This survey asks practicing Linux professionals to rate each task in several ways:

* Frequency: How often they perform the task.
* Importance: How important it is for an administrator to be able to perform the task.

### Data analysis

Finally, we conduct statistical analysis of the survey responses. We compute statistics indicating, on average, how critical respondents rated each task. This analysis guides the determination of the final job task list.

## Linux Essentials

Show employers that you have the foundational skills required for your next job or promotion.

Linux adoption continues to rise world-wide as individual users, government entities and industries ranging from automotive to space exploration embrace open source technologies. This expansion of open source in enterprise is redefining traditional Information and Communication Technology (ICT) job roles to require more Linux skills. Whether you’re starting your career in open source, or looking for advancement, independently verifying your skill set can help you stand out to hiring managers or your management team.

The Linux Essentials certificate also serves as a great introduction to the more complete and advanced Linux Professional certification track.

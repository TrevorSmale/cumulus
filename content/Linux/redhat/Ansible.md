# Overview

Ansible is an open-source automation platform that simplifies IT infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. It allows users to define infrastructure as code using simple, human-readable YAML files, making it easier to automate complex tasks and streamline IT operations.

## History

Ansible was created by Michael DeHaan in 2012 and was later acquired by Red Hat (now part of IBM). It was developed with the goal of providing a simple and agentless automation framework that could be easily adopted and used by IT professionals. Ansible gained popularity due to its ease of use, scalability, and strong community support.

## Key Features

Ansible offers several key features that make it a powerful automation tool:

- **Agentless Architecture:** Unlike many other automation tools, Ansible does not require any agents or additional software to be installed on managed hosts. It uses SSH or WinRM protocols to connect to remote systems, making it lightweight and easy to set up.

- **Declarative Language:** Ansible uses a declarative language called YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) to describe the desired state of systems and infrastructure. YAML files are human-readable and allow users to define configuration and automation tasks in a structured and intuitive manner.

- **Idempotent Execution:** Ansible ensures idempotent execution, meaning that running the same playbook multiple times produces the same result. This feature makes Ansible safe and reliable for automating infrastructure changes and configuration management.

- **Inventory Management:** Ansible provides flexible inventory management, allowing users to define groups of hosts and variables associated with them. This enables targeted execution of tasks on specific hosts or groups of hosts, simplifying orchestration and configuration management.

- **Playbooks and Roles:** Ansible uses playbooks to define automation tasks and workflows. Playbooks are written in YAML and can include multiple roles, which are reusable units of configuration and tasks. This modular approach promotes code reuse and simplifies playbook organization.

- **Extensibility:** Ansible offers a wide range of modules that can be used to interact with various systems and technologies. Additionally, users can create custom modules and plugins to extend Ansible's functionality and integrate it with different tools and platforms.

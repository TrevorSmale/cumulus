Welcome to my organized collection of notes! This website houses my extensive collection of Markdown notes. By moving them online, I can access them conveniently from any device. I also believe others will find valuable information here. To better manage a large number of Markdown files, I've migrated my notes to GO & HUGO. This transition improves organization and simplifies navigation. Feel free to explore and benefit from the resources available. Enjoy!

## Overview

Welcome to my Notes. This site represents my continuing studies of technology and tangentially related subjects.
I try to keep things well organized so that I can refer back.

## Navigation

---

### Desktop

Getting around the site is quite intuitive, the topics listed on the left hand side in desktop mode are the major categories. Some of these categories contain sub-directories containing categorically related notes. 

---

### Mobile

On a mobile phone you will see a hamburger menu (Three Horizontal Lines) that expand to reveal the menu. 

---

### Table of Contents

For each Article there is an interactive hierarchal Table of Contents located on the right hand side. This is only visible on the desktop layout.

---

## Issues and/or Additions

This site and its contents are store in a public GitHub repository. If you would like to raise an issue or submit a pull request, be my guest.

---

## Next/Previous Bar

There is a bar located beneath each article that allows for navigation between Next/Previous Articals with the title 'READ MORE'

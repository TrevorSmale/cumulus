# AZ 104 TOPICS

## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service provided by Microsoft Azure. It serves as the foundation for managing user identities and controlling access to Azure resources. Azure AD allows you to create and manage user accounts, groups, and guest accounts. With Azure AD, you can implement single sign-on (SSO) for seamless access to various applications and services. It also provides features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

## Azure AD Connect

Azure AD Connect is a tool that enables synchronization between an organization's on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD. It ensures that user accounts, groups, and attributes from the on-premises directory are replicated to Azure AD. Azure AD Connect supports different synchronization options, including password hash synchronization, pass-through authentication, and federated authentication. By using Azure AD Connect, organizations can maintain a unified identity management experience across their on-premises and Azure environments.

## Azure AD Roles and RBAC

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a vital component of Azure's security model. RBAC allows you to assign specific roles to users or groups, granting them the necessary permissions to manage Azure resources. Azure provides a set of built-in roles with different levels of access, such as Owner, Contributor, and Reader. Additionally, you can create custom roles to meet specific requirements. RBAC ensures that users have the right level of access to perform their tasks while maintaining security and governance.

## Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

PIM is a service within Azure AD that helps organizations manage and control access to privileged roles. Privileged roles have broad access to Azure resources and need to be carefully monitored and controlled. PIM enables just-in-time (JIT) access, allowing users to acquire elevated access for a limited period when needed. It reduces the risk of prolonged exposure to privileged roles and enhances security by providing time-bound assignments and approval workflows.

## Azure AD Conditional Access

Conditional Access in Azure AD allows you to define policies that enforce specific controls based on various conditions. These policies help protect your Azure resources and data by requiring additional authentication or applying access restrictions under specific circumstances. For example, you can configure policies that enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for specific applications, restrict access based on device compliance, or enforce geographic restrictions. Conditional Access policies provide granular control over access and enhance security by ensuring that only authorized users can access Azure resources.

## Azure Policy

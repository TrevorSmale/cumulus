## Course Overview

Learn to write modern, fast, and secure web applications in Google's Go programming language, and learn it from an award winning University professor with 20 years of teaching experience, and 20 years of experience working in the industry as an entrepreneur.

This course is well-suited for both absolute beginners, and for developers who already know something about web development, but want to add Go to their toolbox.

We start with an overview of the Go language, and then cover everything you need to get started writing web applications, including an overview of HTML5, a survey of JavaScript and JavaScript modules, how to work with Cascading Style Sheets to make our application look the way we want, and much more.

The major project in this course is building a bookings and reservation system for a Bed & Breakfast. Visitors to our site will be able to search for accommodations by date and make an online reservation, and the site owner will be able to manage reservations from a secure back end.

By the time you finish this course, you will have a solid grasp of what it takes to build a completely functional, secure, and fast web application from the ground up, and you will have a solid understanding of the Go programming language.

## Course Notes

Making Modern Web Applications with Go

## What we are going to do

* Learn the fundamentals of the GO programming language
* Build a web application using Golang
* Learn how to deploy to a live server

## What tech stack we are going to use

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* Go
* PostgreSQL

## What the project will comprise

Creating a functional bed and breakfast website with several interactive pages, event handlers and live info panels. The application will also have an administrator backend with user authentication for managing information on the website. We will also be creating tests in order to confirm the function of the code. Mistakes will be made, but we will create a great functional project.

## Why Go and not PHP, Python or Node.js

Nothing wrong with other tools. However Go has significant advantages:

* It compiles to a single binary
* No runtimes to worry about
* Statically typed, so no surprises at run time
* Object oriented (sort of) using interfaces
* Concurrency
* Cross platform
* Excellent package management & testing built in!
* Built in production ready webserver

## Why go (System Resources)

Golang uses:

* Far less system resources
* Tiny memory footprint
* Tiny CPU load
* More uptime

## Installation and setup

Install Go 'Many options' already done
Install VSCode
Install the go extension for VSCODE from the extension marketplace
Bring up command pallete and search GO: install/update Tools
Check select all extension and wait for the install/recompile
